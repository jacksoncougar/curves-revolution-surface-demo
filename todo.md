## MVP

-[x] curve is subdivision or a parametric curve
  -[x] Can edit this curve by inserting control points
  -[x] Can edit this curve by deleting control points
  -[x] Can edit this curve by moving control points
-[x] Different viewports are used to edit the curve than to display the pottery
-[x] Phong shading used during rendering.

## Bonus
-[ ] Change between parametric and [x] subdivision methods to define curves.
  -[ ] User can select the method interactively or my command line option
-[ ] Use a single viewport to both display the render and update the curve.
-[x] Load and save the models
-[x] Improve rendering using texture mapping
-[x] Improve rendering using procedural textures
-[ ] Improve rendering using ray tracing

# Other requirements
-[ ] Compiles on lab machines.
-[/] Code is clear and well documented.
-[ ] Code reuse if clearly outlined in readme.md
